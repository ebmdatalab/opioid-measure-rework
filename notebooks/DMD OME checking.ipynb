    "We have historically used a [presentation-level BNF code-based approach](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IjnHbYVszZKPmVSYydtMVzbDLPOmq8bOFq45QsSu6sE/edit#gid=0) to calculating Oral Morphine Equivalence (OME) for opioid measures.  However, this requires a high level of curation, as any new drug presentation will not automatically appear.  It is also open to a higher degree of error, due to the large number of individual codes and OME values that need to be managed.  A recent review of these codes has found a few errors in the existing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d) offers a solution to this.  It provides information on the amount of drug per dose for each chemical prescribed.  This holds a number of advantages:\n",
    "- as it is linked to individual chemicals, combined products not within the usual BNF codes for these products are picked up\n",
    "- combination products will show up separately for each chemical, and allow simple calculations\n",
    "- any new products, as long as within existing chemical substances and formulations will be picked up\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there is less need for curation, and lower chance of error for using a dm+d-based methodology.  If successful, this metholodology could be expaned to provide more accurate analyses elsewhere, e.g. when calculating Defined Daily Doses (DDD) or Average Daily Quantities (ADQ)"

    "\n",
    ">What we are saying is that this product is listed with 2 different pack sizes:\n",
    ">The 8 dose pack is a special container and is not made up with any sub packs.\n",
    ">However the 32 dose pack is not the special container size and is made up of 4 x 8 subpacks with each sub pack consisting of 8 doses and the 8 dose sub pack is the special container size.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Where a quantity has been dispensed from the actual 8 dose special container pack then this quantity will be represented as the number of packs and not the number of doses.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Where the quantity has been dispensed from the 32 dose pack then this quantity will be represented as the number of doses and not the number of sub packs.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">We appreciate that currently the publicly available data is only available at presentation level so we understand that it is not immediately apparent as to the total number of doses but the actual reimbursement is correct.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Our data will continue to represent the quantity based on what we have outlined above and they are no plans to change this.\n",

    "1) accept there is a data quality issue here, and make explicit the reasons why\n",

To do this, we would take the sum of the net ingredient cost (not actual cost) and divide by £4.56, the price of a single nasal spray for both 100mcg and 400mcg strengths.
